= Logs

** Early Alpha **

Monitor exceptions by navigating to /logs.


Gemfile
  mount Logs::Engine, at: "/logs"


  rake logs:install:migrations


Default username and password to access /logs is

USERNAME:  test
PASSWORD:  1234

To change credentials to access /logs, create file config/logs.yml.  It should look something like this...
  
  production:
    username: 'test'
    password: 'here'
